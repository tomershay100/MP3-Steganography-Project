# MP3-Steganography-Project
This repository combines all the products of our project. Each folder contains a different component of the project, as follows:

* `MP3 Steganography Library`: The MP3-Stego Python library that can be installed and used by anyone for hiding messages in MP3 files (can also be installed via `pip`).
* `MP3 Steganography Web`: A small web application that contains a frontend in bootstrap and a flask server that allows every user to run all of the `mp3stego-lib` library API functions in a user-friendly interface.
* `MP3 Steganography Research`: Our research paper of the project. Contains comprehensive research about the theory behind MP3, steganographic methods for MP3 fles, and an overview of the code flow of our system.
* `MP3 Steganography Scenario`: A small scenario that showcases our system in action. See more information in the README file for that folder.
