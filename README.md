# MP3-Steganography-Project
This repository combines all the products of our project. Each folder in the project contains a different component of the project as follows:
* `mp3 steganography library`: The MP3-Stego library that can be installed and used by anyone for hiding messages in mp3 files (can also be installed via `pip`).
* `mp3 steganography web`: A small web application that contains a frontend in bootstrap and a flask server that allows every user to run all of the `mp3stego-lib` library functions in a user-friendly interface.
* `mp3 steganography research`: Our research paper of the project. Contains comprehansive research about the theory behind MP3, steganographic methods for MP3 fles, and an overview of the code flow of our system.
* `mp3 steganography scenario`: A small scenario that showcases our system in action. See more information in the README file for that folder.
