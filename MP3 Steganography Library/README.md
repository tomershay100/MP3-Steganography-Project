## General

### Background

This python library allows a user to hide strings inside ``MP3`` files, extract the hidden strings from ``MP3`` file,
clean a ``MP3`` file from hidden strings in it and generally allows to convert ``MP3`` files to ``WAV`` (decoding
process) files and vice versa (encoding process).

### Project Description

The steganography process uses and modifies the selection of the optimal (that requires the minimal amount of bits to code the data) Huffman tables as presented in the research article "_High capacity
reversible data hiding in MP3 based on Huffman table
transformation_" (which can be found [here](https://www.aimspress.com/fileOther/PDF/MBE/mbe-16-04-158.pdf)). Quite
simply, the idea is to be able to hide bits by changing the selection of the used Huffman table indexes. Each frame in the ``MP3`` file uses several Huffman tables (one per granule, channel and region - a total of 8-12 tables).

For the steganography we ordered the tables as pairs according to their similarities (from the article), and determined that each table represent the bit 0 or 1. For the sake of demonstration let us assume that the Huffman table x and the Huffman table y are a pair, and that x represents the bit 0 and y represents bit 1. To hide a bit, given that the Huffman table x has been selected as the optimal table, it is replaced with the Huffman table y if the bit is 1, otherwise the table x is selected. An inverted case will happen for original use of table y. 

### Project Structure

The library is contains several packages and several classes built as follows:

1. `decoder` package:
    * **Frame class:** contains all the information about the current ``MP3`` frame that is decoded.
    * **FrameHeader class:** contains all the information about the current ``MP3`` frame's header is decoded.
    * **FrameSideInformation class:** contains all the information about the current ``MP3`` frame's side-information is decoded.        
    * **MP3Parser class:** performs the decoding process while parsing the frames of the file.
    * **ID3Parser class:** performs the decoding process on the ``METADATA`` of the ``MP3``` file.
    * **tables file:** contains all the tables that are used in the decoding process.
    * **util file:** contains all the different functions and dataclasses that other classes use frequently like
      mathematical calculations and bit operations.
    * **Decoder class:** consolidates the ``MP3`` decoding process. Receives paths to files and takes
      care of the decoding process while printing information, creating files and analyzing the ``METADATA``.
2. `encoder` package:
    * **WAVReader class:** contains all the information about the ``WAV`` file that is encoded.
    * **MP3Encoder class:** performs the encoding process.
    * **tables file:** contains all the tables that are used in the encoding process.
    * **util file:** contains all the different functions and dataclasses that other classes use frequently like
      mathematical calculations and bit operations.
    * **Encoder class:** consolidates the ``MP3`` encoding process. Receives paths to files and takes
      care of the encoding process while printing information, creating files.
3. **Steganography class:** serves as a kind of Fa√ßade and allows the user to perform operations on given ``MP3``
   and ``WAV`` files. The possible actions are:
    * decode ``MP3`` file to ``WAV`` file.
    * encode ``WAV`` file to ``MP3`` file.
    * hide a string in the ``MP3`` file.
    * reveal a string hidden in the ``MP3`` file.
    * clean a ``MP3`` file from hidden strings that it might hide.

## Running Instructions

Steganography Class API:

* Creating Steganography object by
    ```python 
  from mp3stego import Steganography
  
  stego = Steganography(quiet=True)
    ```
    * ``quiet: bool``: boolean value for the constructor of the Steganography class that determines if the information about the decoding/encoding process will be printed (default value ``True``).
* for encoding ``WAV`` file into ``MP3`` file you may use
    ```python 
    stego = Steganography(quiet=True)
    stego.encode_wav_to_mp3("input.wav", "output.mp3", 320)
    ```
    * ``wav_file_path: str``: file path for the ``WAV`` file.
    * ``output_file_path: str``: file path for the output ``MP3`` file.
    * ``bitrate: int``: the bitrate that is used in the encoding process (default value is ``320``). You may use bitrate
      from ``32Kb`` to ``420Kb`` in jumps of ``32Kb``.
* For decoding ``MP3`` file into ``WAV`` file you may use
    ```python 
    stego = Steganography(quiet=True)
    stego.decode_mp3_to_wav("input.mp3", "output.wav")
    ```
    * ``input_file_path: str``: file path for the ``MP3`` file.
    * ``wav_file_path: str``: file path for the output ``WAV`` file (default value=```input_file_path[:-4] + ".wav"```).
* For hiding a string in ``MP3`` file you may use
    ```python 
    stego = Steganography(quiet=True)
    stego.hide_message("input.mp3", "output.mp3", "String to hide in the file")
    ```
    * ``input_file_path: str``: file path for the input ``MP3`` file.
    * ``output_file_path: str``: file path for the output ``MP3`` file.
    * ``message: str``: the message to hide in the file.
    * ``wav_file_path: str``: file path for the output ``WAV`` file (default value=```input_file_path[:-4] + ".wav"```).
    * ``delete_wav: bool``: boolean value for the decoding process that determines if the wav file that is created from the decodin process will be deleted. (default value ``True``).
* For revealing a string from a ``MP3`` file you may use
    ```python 
    stego = Steganography(quiet=True)
    stego.reveal_massage("input.mp3", "results.txt")
    ```
    * ``input_file_path: str``: file path for the input ``MP3`` file.
    * ``txt_file_path: str``: file path for the hidden string to be written to.
* For cleaning ``MP3`` file from a hidden string you may use
    ```python 
    stego = Steganography(quiet=True)
    stego.clear_file("input.mp3", "output.mp3")
    ```
    * ``input_file_path: str``: file path for the input ``MP3`` file.
    * ``output_file_path: str``: file path for the output ``MP3`` file.
